## Installation
Clone this repo. Inside the repo, run `pip install requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run `python add_to_minecraft.py`

The script will prompt you through an installation process. After it is done you will be left with a .mcaddon file. Double click, and select `Open With Minecraft Bedrock`

Now create a new superflat world and under behaviour packs enable the pack (its icon matches the image you used.)

Once you are inside the world, you can start the summon by breaking a grass block.
